We probably can structure the ClownStick's brain into various trigger points.

Suggestions 

- walls/borders
- Kim Jong Un
- Refugees
- Making america great again
- CNN 
- The muslim 'problem'
- The art of the deal
- Elephants
- Fake News
- Vendettas
- Cocaine problems/Sniffing



Regarding language, perhaps we should choose something which make you paranoid, 
and leads to mental break-downs, to experience the clownstick's thought processes as closely as possible.
A strong contender may be assembly. 

However, since the clownstick's brain is already pre-programmed in simplicity that might be asking too much.
Hence, I suggest something more basic. 

Strong contenders would be any modern top 10 language. (Obviously I have strong preferences for Object pascal) 
but open to suggestions.


Algorithm Details
Once we've scraped twitter, we can probably start structuring clownstick's brain responses into weighting regarding 1) percieved importance of the subject matter, 2) number of responses from Clownstick, 3) number of likes for responses from Clownstick, broken down into supporters/haters, and yeah, so we'd probably need an algorithm to scrape some data from there, too.

Hey, I didn't say it was easy.
