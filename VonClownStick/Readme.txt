We probably can structure the ClownStick's brain into various trigger points.

Suggestions 

- walls
- Kim Jong Un
- Refugees
- Making america great again
- CNN 


Regarding language, perhaps we should choose something which make you paranoid, and leads to mental break-downs, to experience the clownstick's thought processes as closely as possible. A strong contender may be assembly. 

However, since the clownstick's brain is already pre-programmed in simplicity that might be asking too much. Hence, I suggest something
more basic. 

Strong contenders would be any modern top 10 language. (Obviously I have strong preferences for Object pascal) but open to suggestions.
